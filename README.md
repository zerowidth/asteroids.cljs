# Asteroids

If you wish to play asteroids, you must first invent the universe.

This is an experiment in ClojureScript, physics simulation, rendering on the
web, and game design. It's for me, not you, but enjoy what you find.

```
$ script/bootstrap # to install dependencies
$ script/server    # to start cljs auto-compilation
$ script/test      # to start test runner
```
